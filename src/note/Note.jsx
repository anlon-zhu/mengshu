            Happy birthday!! I can't believe I've had the fortune to date you for a year now (well almost).
            </p>

            <p>
            I still remember your last birthday, and I know it wasn't the greatest... but this year I endeavored to make it the best it can be from where I am.
            We've both grown so much together and our love has grown stronger. We've learned to overcome our differences, to tend to each other's vulnerabilities, to take care of each other. I'm really proud of the both of us, and I can't believe our lives crossed paths. It seems like a dream still.
            </p>

            <p>
            I love you so much. This is from the agap√©, but I love you because of your kind heart, your thoughtfulness and willingness to self reflect
            and change, and even your anxieties/fears over a ton of things (though I'll be there to help you with them always, you are adorable for them). I love your for your smile that never fails to warm my heart, your laugh that brightens the room, and your kind kind eyes (and your sexy mf body ofc).
            </p>

            <p>
            I love you for your excitement over tiny things. I love you for your willingness to try foods, to look for new places to date, to plan activities.
            </p>

            <p>
            You are so beautiful. Every time I see you I smile. You are beautiful inside and out, and you don't need make up, but your make up is amazing. Your fits are adorable always--even if you're just wearing my t-shirt. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I love you megan, and I can't help but reminisce about all of our fun moments. Our beach trips, hangouts and big circle, cooking, keshi, ghibli museum, movies, bowling, and so much more. I cannot imagine doing that with anyone else. It's only been a year. Isn't that crazy? I feel like we've lived a hundred lives together already.
            </p>

            <p>
            I can't imagine calling someone else at the end of a long day, or telling someone else about my feelings, or just having a good time existing with anyone else. I cannot imagine flying home to anyone else's warm embrace.
            </p>

            <p>
            I love your hugs and cuddles. For me, you are home. I will love you no matter where I am, and I want to protect your smile.
            </p>

            <p>
            I miss you so much, but I see you soon!! I love you and I can't wait to hug you. I hope you have the best 19th year ever. I hope you love your gift and this collection of just some of our memories. Here's to a million more memories: *cheers*
            </p>

            <p>
            Your loving boyfriend, xoxo
